<h2>About me</h2>

<h2>City</h2>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<ol>
<li>Music: One of my favorite things to do is to listen to music. Music has always fascinated me since I was a young boy. I like all sorts of genres but I'm more deep into Indie, Alternative, Rock and House recently. I also like going to concerts frequently.</li>
<li>Movies &amp; TV Shows: This is one of my favorites when I'm bored. Specially TV shows, since I feel they get me more connected with the plot. I like all sorts of TV shows and movies.</li>
<li>Nature &amp; Animals: I like to go camping once in a while and to walk my dog in the woods. I love dogs and cats (but mostly dogs).</li>
